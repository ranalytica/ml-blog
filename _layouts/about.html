	<p>Hi, this is Yassine! I'm currently a 2nd year PhD student, working at the intersection of CV and NLP for 
		multi-modal document analysis and understanding @ <a href="https://www.centralesupelec.fr/" target="_blank">CentraleSup√®lec</a>. </p>

	<p>My goal with this blog is to share ML related things that I've
		learned & find intersting, that it is, in the clearest and most straightforward way without losing any substance.
		And testing my understanding of the subjects, to see if I really <i>know</i> something, or only its name.</p>
