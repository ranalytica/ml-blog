My personal page / blog, built using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

If you would like to use this template, you can simply create a repo named `GHusername.github.io`, clone this repo and
push it to the repo you've juste created, change the corresponding fields in `_config.yml` and 
the logs and backgrounds in `images` and your website will be up and running.
If you wish, you can also change the HTML and css layouts that are 
defined in `_layouts/`, `_includes/` and `_sass`.

For more details, see the original template this was based on [so-simple-theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme)
