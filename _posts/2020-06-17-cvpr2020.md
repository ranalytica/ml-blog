The first virtual CVPR conference ended, with 1467 papers accepted, 29 tutorials, 64 workshops, and 7k virtual attendees. The huge number of papers and the new virtual version made navigating the conference overwhelming (and very slow) at times. To get a grasp of the general trends of the conference this year, I will present in this blog post a biased snapshot of the conference by summarizing some papers that grabbed my attention.

*Disclaimer: This post is not a representation of the papers and subjects presented in CVPR; it is just a personnel overview of what I found interesting. Any feedback is welcomed!*

# CVPR 2020 in numbers
The statistics presented in this section are taken from the official [Opening & Awards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHUYXtbwl_8&t=1903s) presentation. Let's start
by some general statistics:

<figure style="width: 100%" class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ 'images/CVPR20/acceptance.png' | absolute_url }}">
</figure>

The trends of earlier years continued with a 20% increase in authors and a 29% increase in submitted papers, joined by the rising of the number of reviewers and area chairs to accommodate this expansion.

Similar to last year, China is the first contributor to CVPR in terms of accepted papers with Tsinghua University with the most significant number of authors, followed by the USA as the second contributor by country and Google by the organization.

</figure>

As expected, the majority of the accepted papers focus on topics related to learning, recognition, detection, and understanding. However, there is an increasing interest in relatively new areas such as label-efficient methods (e.g., transfer learning), image synthesis and robotic perception. Some emerging topics like fairness and explain AI are also starting to gather more attention within the computer vision community.
