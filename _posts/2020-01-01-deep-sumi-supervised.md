title: "Deep Semi-Supervised Learning"
excerpt: "Given the large amounts of training data required to train deep nets,
          but collecting big detasets is not cost nor time effective. As a result 
          there is a growing need to develop data efficient methods.
          Semi-supservised learning (SSL) is possible solutions to such hurdles. In this blog post
          we present some of the new advance in SSL in the age of Deep Learning."
